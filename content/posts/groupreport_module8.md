This week, we have continued to attempt to establish our hosting for our group WordPress site. We have been struggling trying to get this working, but we have been able to utilize the “I can” statement of using self-directed learning by Google searching and troubleshooting the issues we are having. In addition, we decided that since we are still unable to host the site, we can at least move forward with content that will be on the site so we are not complete stagnant with the project. We divided up some content that each member can bring to class on Wednesday and review them. Despite the hosting issues with WordPress, our group has been able to maintain great workflows and communication, as well as begin to work outside of class on the project, which will be important to stay on schedule.
