Our group has been off to a great start in formulating an idea for our website and company. We have decided to do a website for custom keyboards specifically making keyboards on demand. Mesam came up with the idea due to his knowledge about keyboards. In addition, we are very happy with the balance of front-end and back-end strategists in our group. Mesam and Ash are more back-end focused, having the discipline of working with different software and hardware. Whereas, Connor and I are more front-end focused, having experience in working directly with consumers. Overall, we are thrilled to get started on our website and for the time ahead we tend to develop a great website for our services, as we as a team are feeling confident.
