Our group has been off to a great start in formulating an idea for our website and company. We have decided to do a website for a PC Building and Repair company that sells computer parts, too. Mesam came up with the idea due to his knowledge about PCs, and we decided to add in a repairs portion in case the PC building gets too complex. In addition, we are very happy with the balance of front-end and back-end strategists in our group. Mesam and Ash are more back-end focused, having the discipline of working with different software. Connor and I are more front-end focused, having experience in workers directly with consumers. Overall, we are thrilled to get started on our website because we are confident we will create a great product.
