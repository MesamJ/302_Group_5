My biggest I can statement this week was "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." This was due to me doing various things revolving around our Wordpress class project. I am starting to use 'inspect element' and 'view page source' a ton. I am using these things to try to figure out what the current site is using in terms of fonts, themes, plugins, etc. This is helping me understand how the site is built and what I can do to help replicate it.
