This week, our group has really moved along progress with our keyboard website. We have established our templates, and they are looking they way we want. In addition, we have completed our contact page besides the social media links that need to be removed. We have also began entering our products into our website which is exciting because we were struggling with this for the past couple of weeks. Overall, we are finally making large amounts of progress, and we look forward to seeing the final site.
