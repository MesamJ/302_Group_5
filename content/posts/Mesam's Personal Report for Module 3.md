This week we started to work on the group contract and while I was doing that with my team, I learned to find and use resources for self-directed learning. When we were working on our contract using GitHub, I learned that using “#” helps to change the size of the headers and an “Asterisk” is used to put bullet points in the text. For this week I can say that I learned a bit about how to use and edit text using the markdown language with the help of self-directed learning.
