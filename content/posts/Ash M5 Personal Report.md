For this weeks personal report the I can statement I resonate with is "I can describe and compare content management systems." I have not been able to attend class as often as I often would like to due to some family issues. With that said I have been able to keep in contact with my group and look over the items assigned to us. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of content managemen systems in general and I often find myself asking "what is not a content management system" vs "what is a content management system." WHile Youtube and Spotify are not anything like Wordpress and Hugo they are all still content management systems with different purposes.
