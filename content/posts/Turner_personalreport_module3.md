This week, I have begun to understand two of the "I can" statements of the course. The first one I have begun to unpack is the statement "I can manage content using established workflows". While creating our group contract in class, I began typing all of our ideas onto a word document while brainstorming criteria for each letter grade. From there, I sent the pdf version to my group in Microsoft Teams to ensure we had all of the criteria deemed necessary. After everyone was able to look over the contract, we then entered it into GitHub so it would be on our Hugo website. This required establishment of workflows due to using different software and formats easily accessible by each group member to finalize our initial group contract. The second "I can" statement I began to learn is "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning". My group and I found resources for self-learning when trying to discover how to make bulleted lists and different headers in Markup. With a few Google searches and some collaboration, we were able to self-teach and learn how to accomplish these tasks.
