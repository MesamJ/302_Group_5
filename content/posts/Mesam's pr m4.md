As we move forward with our group project and community partners, I have started to understand the importance of establishing workflows. In my understanding, establishing content management workflows have a pattern which starts by forming a strategy, creating the content, reviewing the quality, and finally publishing the content. This is what a basic workflow would look like but since workflows are very flexible there can be many more steps in an advanced workflow. Establishing a workflow helps with saving time and keeping things in order which can ultimately help with increased productivity as the team would know what to do and when to do it. Since, we will be working with two projects simultaneously establishing effective workflows will help us keep track of our individual tasks and produce content that will suffice the needs our teammates and our community partners.
