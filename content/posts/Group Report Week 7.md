Like last week, we did honestly not accomplish a lot this week in terms of project progress but we are still doing a great job of working together. We are stuck on locally hosting our site, as we spent all of Wednesday trying to figure it out. Although we are still having problems, we will get it sorted out this week and continue to emphasize cooperation and teamwork.
