A big piece of progress we made this week was really figuring out how to fully use github/edit our hugo site. We have gotten much more comfortable making changes, and that is in large part due to us working together well and having excellent teamwork. For example, we figured out how to create headers and bullets. Secondly, we were able to come up with our group contract. We took a lot of time trying to make sure we made very high standards for ourselves. Not only did we set general goals for things like working hard and having proper grammar, but also things much more specific. We wanted to make sure we completed certain pieces related to our faux-company, as to make the website as realistic as possible. This comes in the form of things like customer reviews, multiple keyboard models, etc.
