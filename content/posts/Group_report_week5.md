Overall, our group is continuing great communication and distribution of tasks. During the exercise on Wednesdayâ€™s class, we were able to begin to set up a menu and even change the theme of our Hugo site. We were able to do this through our brainstorming of ideas, knowledge from lectures, and researching on our own. We were also able to come up with more ideas while experimenting with Hugo. For example, while changing around on our Hugo site, we thought of the idea to have a similar search feature to the one of the new theme. The search feature in this new theme searched the titles and content of the posts currently on the site. With this, we plan on implementing something like this in order for the potential customer to find a keyboard faster. The search feature will be able to search prices, descriptions, and names of the keyboards on our website. We believe this will make the process of purchasing a keyboard simpler for everyone, especially those who might not know much about them and their differences.
