This personal individual contract reflects my duties and tasks that I will be undertaking for this project. 
# A
My first main task would be to assist with both back-end and front-end tasks which includes designing, developing, maintenance and troubleshooting of the website. My second major task that I will be responsible for will be to define the products we feature on our website. If I am able to successfully achieve both of these tasks then I should be given an A
# B
If my description of the products is insufficient or if I am lacking a bit with the developers role then I deserve a B.
# C
I would deserve a C if I put effort in my work, but the execution of either roles is inadequate, and I anchor the performance of my teammates.
# D
If I lack in communication with my teammates and completely fail to do either of the two tasks which are being the administrator and defining/describing the products, then I would deserve a D.
# F
If I cut out communication completely with my teammates and fail to accomplish both tasks assigned to me then I deserve a F.
