For each member in my group, we have all decided to base our personal contracts on our strengths, allowing us to provide our best work towards the project. These are the tasks I have decided to commit to leading our group in accomplishing. 
# A:
My first main task will be writing the testimonials page, the contact us page, and the about us page with Conner. I feel that I am a strong writer, so I want to contribute that aspect to the group project by writing the text for those pages. Next, I will be the overall grammar, spelling, and syntax editor to ensure proper grammar, spelling, and syntax usage throughout the website. In addition, I have taken on the role of being the facilitator and leader of communication in my group. By taking on this role, I want to guarantee that our group is communicating during and outside of class to make sure we are all on the same page concerning the project. Lastly, I will assist with the design of the overall website and description of keyboards with the whole group. 
# B:
For a B, I would do all of the tasks stated above despite the communicator task. If I decide to take on this role of being responsible for group communication but I do not follow up on that task, then I believe a B grade would be sufficient.
# C:
I think a C grade would be if I only contribute to two of the three pages I promised to assist with. This would be a major let down for the group considering I am confident about completing this aspect for the project.
# D:
A D grade for me would be only contributing to one of the three pages I stated I wanted to work with. In addition, this grade would also be a result of very little group communication leadership.
# F:
An F grade would be not accomplishing any of the pages I wanted to do, many grammar, spelling, and syntax errors in the final project, and no group communication. 

# Summary:
Overall, I am very confident in my group and our wide range of experience, dedication, and knowledge. Thus, I am excited to begin this project to learn more about content management systems through working with my peers.
