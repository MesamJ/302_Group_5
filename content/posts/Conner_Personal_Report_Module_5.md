This week, I feel like I really covered the "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management" statement. This is due to us getting put into our Wordpress groups and starting to experiment in the sandbox. I have done research and watched videos about Wordpress, but have not actually gotten into it and started to try getting comfortable. The class sandbox is a great tool for us to get used to different things in Wordpress, and I already have begun employing things that I watched people do in the tutorial videos.
