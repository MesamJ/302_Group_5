This week, I was able to further my understand of the I can statement identifying and employing technologies related to content management. This week we finally figured out how to begin using Wordpress with the templates and plug ins we have installed for the group project. Wordpress is a great example of a technologies related to content management because of its assistance to website building and other optimizing features. I have also used the I can statement of self-directed learning because of the bumps in the road we have run into this week. By using outside sources and self-directed learning, we have been able to resolve these issues as a group and sometimes on our own.
