Although we did not do a ton as a group this week, we still furthered our teamwork skills and improved chemistry. This mostly came Wednesday while we were downloading Wordpress on our machines. This was no easy task, and would have been very difficult to do alone. However, we all helped each other complete our installations, even with some of us on different operating systems. It was a small task, but still something that at least somewhat improved our team functionality.
