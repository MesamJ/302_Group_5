I feel like I have been able to relate to the first I can statement of how I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management through the concept of content. I think that I can identify what content is through its defining characteristics. In further detail, I have learned about the humanization of content, both in terms of its creation and its intended audience. I never really thought in detail about how content needs these things, but it makes complete sense. I really enjoyed the discussion about how AI writting-assistance tools can be considered or not be considered part of "human" writing. I also have learned more about front and back end work, specifically how back end does not necesarrily mean rigorous coding/programming. I thought that back end work had to be extremely technical but I now realize that it can even be something like content organization and editing.
