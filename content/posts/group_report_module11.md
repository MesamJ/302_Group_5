This week, our group has finally began putting our content into our websites after continued struggles with themes, templates, and plug ins. However, we have finally been able to resolve these issues for the most part so we can really move the project forward. Overall, we are very happy we established a workflow to write most of our content on a word processor prior to building the website which prevented further delay in our progress. We are very proud of our website so far, and we are excited to see more progress in the upcoming weeks.
