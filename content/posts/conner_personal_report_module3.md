I feel like I heavily related to the I can statement "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning" this week. I did this in a couple ways. I wanted to continue learning Wordpress on my own, so I have been watching videos about how to download and tweak themes. I want to feel prepared for when we start working on the site. I also tried to become more knowledgable in custom keyboards so that I can feel confident in designing a website about them.
