The I can statement that I can relate to this week was regarding finding resources for self-directed learning. As we move on with both client projects and personal projects there are a lot of hurdles that I am facing which including setting up a wordpress site that can be hosted and accessed by others. The reason I am unable to so is becasue of the fact that WAMP server is not working. I have tried many different solotions but none of them seems to work and I am plannning on switching to XAMP and hopefully that will work for us. Also, while working on the client projects we ran into an issue where we were unable to download images so with a little bit of playing around with the website I found a hack where you could use the inspect elements page and was able to find all the images with the correct resolution and format and not just images I could lovate all the plugins themes and anything that the website was originally using.
