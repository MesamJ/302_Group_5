I felt like my biggest I can statement this week was "I can describe and compare content management systems." Although we have been learning about/using Hugo for a while and Wordpress for a few weeks, we are now really getting into what Wordpress is all about. We are trying things out in the sandbox and making real time changes. We have also become more comfortable further customizing our websites in Hugo with things like themes and font color. This work has shown us the similiarities and differences between the two more than any other time this year.
