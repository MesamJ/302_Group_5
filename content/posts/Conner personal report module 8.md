My biggest I can statement this week was "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." Although we could not get our local site to run on multiple machines, we still were able to work on our group project. We did this by looking for themes/templates on our own laptops and comparing them to find the best one for our needs. We also did this by beginning to write content out on paper and decide our layout. This will help speed up our process greatly in the future when we get the site up and running.
