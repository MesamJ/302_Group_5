The following contract outlines the duties I will be fuffilling for our group project during this class.  
During this project I will be doing a lot of learning as well as doing. For instance, since there aren't really many front-end and back-end jobs I will be doing mainly back-end jobs with Mesam. 
# A:
My main task in this class is to learn and to ask questions. Mesam and I will be focusing on the coding side of things as well as the general design of the webiste. An example of A work is getting my tasks done on time, asking questions when I require help, genuienly taking time to learn, and designating time every week to work on my tasks. A good ling of communication with the group is also imperative to the success of the website and an A grade
# B:
As far as a B grade goes, I would probably end up falling short of a couple of deadlines and not designating as much time as I should to this project.
# C:
As far as a C grade goes, I would not only end up falling short of deadlines and not designating as much time as I should to the project, but there would also be a hige lack of communication on my end.
# D:
A D grade would look like me not really doing much of the work and being super unresponsive to the team.
# F:
An F grade would look like not doing any of the project.
