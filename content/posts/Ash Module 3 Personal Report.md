For this weeks I can statement, I decided to go with "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning." One of my best friends is a CS major and she uses github a lot. She mentioned that you can do a lot of different things when it comes to tweaking the text color and the boldness and so on. I started to look into it the other day and realized you can do a lot more manipulation with how data looks than I originally thought. I'm planning on making some sample posts and playing around with it this week before I really start to use it from post to post. Last Friday I had a migraine so I was unable to come to class, but I know that my group figured out how to do things like bullet points so I plan on learning more about that as well.
