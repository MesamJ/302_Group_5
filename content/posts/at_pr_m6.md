This week, I was able to further my understand of the I can statement identifying and employing technologies related to content management. This week we began working on the websites for our community partners which allowed me to dive into using Wordpress. I believe Wordpress is an excellent example of a technology related to content management. Wordpress's original intent was to be a blog builder, but it has now evolved into an in-depth site builder with many different features, plug-ins, and extensions. We even discussed in class how many big companies use Wordpress to build and update their websites. One example of these companies is Vice. Vice is a magazine discusses everything from politics to the arts. This comapany's use of Wordpress specifically has allowed me to understand different technologies used to assist content management. Since Vice is essetially a conglomeration of different stories and articles, Wordpress helps with keep that content in a organized manner that is easy for their audience to consume.
