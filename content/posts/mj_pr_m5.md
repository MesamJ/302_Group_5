This week I can describe and compare different content management systems as I learned new things about Wordpress and what makes Wordpress a better content management system compared to other content management systems like Shopify. I also learned how to spot a Wordpress website using different techniques one of which is using /wp-admin. Apart from wordpress I also worked with microsoft teams and learned how to set up planners and assign group members to different tasks which helped in managing the content through an established workflow. As I was trying to download images from the daybreak website I learned how to use resources for self directed learning as for some reason I was unable to download images on Chrome so I had to inspect the page and download images from the resources.
