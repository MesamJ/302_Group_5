This week, I felt that I most managed content using established workflows. This is because of my work on the Daybreak site. I have taken the content from their original site, and worked on transferring it over to our new site. I did a good portion of that this week for the page I am working on, getting all of the text and images over. I also did a lot of work on the presentation of these items. Now I just need to finalize the layout and styling.
