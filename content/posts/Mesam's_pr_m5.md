For this week I can describe and compare content management systems as I have been working a lot with Github and Hugo and while doing so I learned that Github can be very tricky and confusing to use specially if you are trying to edit an existing theme code. Also, I learned how confusing it can be to upload a picture on Hugo where you have to be careful of the syntax compared to Wordpress where you can just select an image and upload it. All in all I had a lot of fun trying to work my way around ananke theme code and trying different themes like Hugo_Book and Parsa.
