# A:  

* For an A, I would want to give my full effort to every single thing I do on this project. I want to always be in constant communication with my team members, making sure we are all on the same page whenever it comes to our duties. In terms of techical tasks, I will do the majority of the writing and some of the design/organization of the homepage. I will write faux-user reviews and assist Allsion on the writing of the testimonies, contact us, and about us pages. Finally, I will be ready to assist team members with whatever other help is needed, whether that be front or back-end.

# B:  
* A good amount of effort given, but not enough to constitute an A. I would stay in touch with team members, but not always check the GroupMe as frequently as I should. If any of the tasks I set out to do solo were not done to the best of my ability but still pretty good, that would be a B. If I did not assist Allison, our other front-end worker as much as I should be.

# C:
* Even less effort is given, but it is enough to get most of my work done. I take way too long to respond to group members and leave them hanging on communication. My tasks either do not get completed all the way or are not to the same level of my grouo member's effort.


# D: 
* Very minimal effort is given on all of my work throughout the project. I constantly take at least a day to respond to group members and do not show up for meetings. My tasks are extremely poorly done.

# E: 
* Almost no effort is given, my group memebers only hear from me in class. All of my tasks are either not completed or thrown together in very little time/not finished.
