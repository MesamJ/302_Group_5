This week. our group made significant progress. After a little bit of stagnation and issues with our site, we feel like we are finally getting somewhere. We were able to get our storepage running and edit/add items, something we had been trying to do for a while. We all hade been working very hard trying to figure out the problem, and felt very relieved once we realized it was a plugin permission issue. We now are setup in a good position to make significant progress this coming week.
