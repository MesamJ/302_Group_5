Since the beginning of this course, we as a team have gained understanding of various new skills which are not only limited to technology but also elaborate on our own individual strengths. Keeping our strengths and individual technical skills in mind roles were ascribed to each group member where Allison and Conner will be working as editors and site planners and Allison will also be the one to ensure that the whole team is staying in touch and communicating effectively. Mesam decided to take the administrator role so he will be focused on both back-end and front-end. Mesam and Ash will be describing the specifics of the keyboards and will work as a site developers due to their knowledge and interest in the product and will be focused on writing and looking over the code and design of the website. That being the case, all of us will be wearing multiple hats and will be helping each other out. Furthermore, we are all pleased with the designated roles as these roles will help us learn and hone our desired skills.
