So far throughout the course, I am beginning to be able to identify and define key concepts in content management. During our first week of class, we discussed the definition of content itself. As I have learned, content is defined as information that is creating using an editorial process and intended for human consumption. However, the intention for humans can get tricky when trying to determine if something is content or not since there is no definitive answer to decide if something is completely content or not. Lastly, we have discussed the difference between content strategists: front-end and back-end. Front-end strategists are focused on the creative, consumer presented side, where as back-end strategists are focused on the technical side of content including editing, sorting, and organizing the content.
