This week, I have further developed the “I can” statement of establishment of workflows through my group project. We have finally been able to resolve the hosting issue because all fo the groups were having trouble, but we are still continuing writing some of the content we want on the website on a different word processor we had a late start. It has been a pretty relaxed and reflective week so not much to add as far as learning objectives.
