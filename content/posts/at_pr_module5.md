This week, I was able to further my understand if the I can statement of describe and comparing content management systems. This week we discussed the differences between Hugo and WordPress. First, Hugo is simplistic, fast, easier to use, and not database affiliated. However, Hugo can be limiting and unforgiving. For example, we were changing the theme for our group Hugo page, and since one letter was off in the code, the website was not functioning. This is the unforgiving nature of the CMS which can be frustrating. In addition, Hugo did not have many options for themes to begin with. This explains its simplistic and fast description. Although, we briefly discussed WordPress in comparison, it was mentioned that WordPress is more complex and more powerful as it is database affiliated. From my understanding, this means it has more accessible options due to the database aspect.
