This week in class I have began to have a deeper understanding of the I can statement which involves using established workflows. We are continuing working on both our group projects and the projects for our community partners, but these different groups require different workflows since there are different tasks for both projects. We have been able to move farther along with the community partner project because of the established workflows decided as a class. However, our group projects is also going well except the confusions involving MAMP to be able to host the WordPress website. Nonetheless, I think we have established clear roles and communication in both my group project group and my community partner group which will contribute to the success of both projects.
