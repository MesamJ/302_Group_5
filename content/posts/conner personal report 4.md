In additon to many people in our class (I'm assuming), I felt like the big I can statement this week was managing content using established workflows. Friday in class we had an extremely productive session figuring out how we were going to work on the class project and divide our work. Although our workflows are not set in stone and final, we still made a ton of progress. We talked about dividing our front/back-end people, but also other things like having work-checking roles to make sure everyone is doing what they need to be doing. Overall, it was a great day to initially set up how we are going to excel in our project.
