This past week we have started to figure out what group member is doing what. And since we have narrowed down our idea and it wasn't picked for us we had to figure out what jobs to give to everyone. For this week I would say my I can statement is "I can manage content using established workflows". This week we really had to put our heads together to figure out what jobs were the best for our current knowledge. I will say I am slighly anxious abou the project because I feel like I have a leg behind everyone else. I'm not super experienced when it comes to coding but I am really willing to learn. I'm very optomistic about this project.

Also in relation to last weeks post, you have to download some kind of "pack" for github to add colors. However it is possible to change the font and highlight some things.
