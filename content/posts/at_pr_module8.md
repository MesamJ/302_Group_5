This week, I have further developed the “I can” statement of establishment of workflows through my group project and the community partner project. With the group project, we have not been able to host our WordPress site, which has hindered our progress on the project. However, I suggested that we begin writing some of the content we want on the website on a different word processor so we do not get too behind. As far as the community project, I have tried to delegate different tasks for different members in my group since WordPress only allows one editor on each page at a time. This can be frustrating, but by establishing workflows, we can divide up the work and tasks that do not all require editing on WordPress. Some examples include downloading the images from the original Daybreak site, figuring out the form extension/widget used on the home page, and more.
